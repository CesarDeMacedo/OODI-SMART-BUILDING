# OODI SMART BUILDING INTELLIGENCE — PROJECT CONTEXT

## 1. Project Overview

This project is a self-initiated interactive web application focused on Helsinki Central Library Oodi.

The application will combine real public-building energy data, current weather information, verified building context and a clearly identified conceptual IoT layer.

The primary purpose is to demonstrate how building information, operational data and spatial visualization can be transformed into a clear and engaging digital experience.

This is a portfolio project, not an official application created for Oodi, the City of Helsinki, Nuuka or WSP.

---

## 2. Strategic Purpose

The project is being developed for inclusion in a portfolio directed to a Digital Advisory Lead working within WSP Property & Buildings.

The application should demonstrate how Cesar De Macedo could contribute to Digital Advisory teams through:

* real-time and near-real-time data visualization;
* smart-building experience prototyping;
* digital twin experience concepts;
* browser-based interactive applications;
* technical storytelling;
* client and stakeholder communication;
* AI-assisted application development;
* built-environment visualization.

The project should not attempt to present Cesar as a building-systems engineer, data engineer or operational digital twin specialist.

The intended positioning is:

> A digital experience and real-time visualization specialist who can complement advisory, engineering and digital-delivery teams by transforming complex building information into accessible visual and interactive experiences.

---

## 3. Primary Audience

The primary audience is:

* Digital Advisory leaders;
* Property & Buildings professionals;
* smart-building consultants;
* digital twin specialists;
* building-performance teams;
* asset-management teams;
* BIM and digital-delivery professionals;
* engineering and advisory stakeholders;
* potential employers and collaborators.

The application must be understandable by both technical and non-technical users.

## 4. Building

### Public Name

Helsinki Central Library Oodi

### Exact Nuuka Property Name

4669 Oodi Helsingin keskustakirjasto

### Property Code

091-002-0014-0005

### Building Code

103534449X

### Purpose of Use

G kirjasto

### Location

Töölönlahdenkatu 4, Helsinki, Finland

### Why Oodi Was Selected

Oodi is a strong subject for this project because it is:

* a contemporary public building;
* architecturally distinctive;
* technologically advanced;
* highly occupied and people-centred;
* relevant to smart-building operations;
* connected to energy, comfort and facility-management topics;
* visually suitable for a high-quality portfolio experience;
* aligned with Property & Buildings and Digital Advisory.

---

## 5. Confirmed Public Data

The Nuuka Open API discovery phase confirmed that Oodi is available through the public Helsinki property dataset.

The following reporting groups are available:

* Electricity
* Heat
* Water
* District Cooling

### Units

* Electricity: kWh
* Heat: kWh
* District Cooling: kWh
* Water: m³

### Available Granularity

Depending on the reporting group and period:

* hourly;
* daily;
* monthly.

### Historical Availability

Monthly data is available from approximately 2018 for some reporting groups.

### Latest Data

The latest timestamp varies by reporting group.

The application must not assume that all utilities share the same update date.

Every data group must display its own:

* latest available timestamp;
* source;
* unit;
* granularity;
* selected period.

### API Access

Browser-side API access was successfully validated.

* HTTP status: 200
* CORS: successful
* Proxy or backend: not currently required for Nuuka data

The `nuuka-discovery-report.md` file is the technical source of truth for exact endpoints, dates, responses and availability.

---

## 6. Data Classification

The application must clearly distinguish between three data types.

### A. Real Public Building Data

Provided by the Nuuka Open API:

* electricity;
* heat;
* water;
* district cooling;
* historical trends;
* latest available readings.

### B. Real Weather Data

To be integrated in a later phase:

* current outdoor temperature;
* humidity;
* wind;
* precipitation;
* weather condition;
* forecast;
* relevant heating or cooling context.

### C. Conceptual IoT and Operational Data

These values may be simulated for experience-prototyping purposes:

* occupancy;
* indoor temperature;
* indoor comfort;
* CO₂;
* indoor air quality;
* HVAC status;
* asset health;
* maintenance alerts;
* system status;
* floor or zone conditions.

Conceptual data must never be presented as real Oodi operational data.

It must be visibly labelled with language such as:

* Conceptual IoT Layer
* Simulated Operational Indicators
* Experience Prototype Data
* Illustrative Sensor Data

---

## 7. Data Transparency Principles

The project must be technically honest.

The interface should always communicate:

* what data is real;
* what data is simulated;
* the data source;
* the unit;
* the last available timestamp;
* the update frequency;
* the selected period;
* missing or delayed readings;
* when fallback data is being used.

Avoid calling Nuuka utility data “live” when it is delayed or updated daily.

Preferred language:

* Latest available building data
* Public energy data
* Near-real-time building information
* Most recent available reading

“Live” may be used only for genuinely current weather information.

---

## 8. Recommended Time Windows

The product should support three principal time windows.

### Operational View

Latest 24 hours, using hourly data when available.

Purpose:

* recent activity;
* hourly consumption;
* short-term variation;
* current operational context.

### Trend View

Latest 30 days, using daily data.

Purpose:

* consumption trend;
* peaks;
* averages;
* comparison with previous periods;
* weather relationship.

### Historical View

Latest 12 months, using monthly data.

Purpose:

* seasonality;
* annual context;
* heating and cooling patterns;
* executive-level trends.

If a reporting group does not support a selected window, the application should use a documented fallback rather than fabricating values.

---

## 9. Initial Product Concept

Working title:

# Oodi Smart Building Intelligence

Alternative subtitle:

> A digital building experience combining public energy data, weather context and conceptual IoT visualization.

The experience should help users understand:

* how the building consumes energy;
* how energy use changes over time;
* how weather may influence heat and cooling;
* how different building systems relate;
* how operational information can be communicated visually;
* how real data and spatial context can support stakeholder understanding.

---

## 10. Proposed Application Sections

The exact structure will be defined in the PRD, but the current direction includes:

### Overview

* building identity;
* location;
* current Helsinki weather;
* latest data update;
* high-level utility summary;
* data transparency status.

### Energy

* electricity;
* heat;
* district cooling;
* 24-hour, 30-day and 12-month views;
* trends and comparisons.

### Water

* average consumption;
* peaks or anomalies;
* latest available reading.

### Building Intelligence

* visual representation of Oodi;
* building systems;
* spatial overlays;
* conceptual IoT indicators;
* clearly labelled simulated information.

### Insights

* automatically calculated observations;
* unusual consumption;
* period comparisons;
* weather-related context;
* plain-language explanations.

### Data Transparency

* Nuuka Open API;
* weather-data source;
* real versus simulated classification;
* units;
* timestamps;
* update frequency;
* methodology and disclaimers.

## 11. Visual Direction

The final application should look:

* sophisticated;
* modern;
* architectural;
* technical;
* clean;
* premium;
* easy to understand;
* suitable for an executive and advisory audience.

The visual style should avoid:

* generic SaaS dashboard aesthetics;
* excessive cards;
* visual clutter;
* heavy neon effects;
* misleading futuristic interfaces;
* unsupported operational claims.

The design should balance:

* architecture;
* data;
* spatial context;
* human-centred communication;
* strong visual hierarchy;
* clear data provenance.

---

## 12. MVP Scope

The first functional MVP should include:

* working Nuuka API integration;
* Oodi property identification;
* electricity, heat, water and district cooling;
* normalized data structures;
* latest-reading logic;
* 24-hour, 30-day and 12-month views where supported;
* weather integration;
* loading, error and empty states;
* data-source and timestamp labels;
* clear separation of real and conceptual data;
* responsive browser interface;
* one polished building-intelligence experience;
* portfolio-quality screenshots.

---

## 13. Out of Scope for the Initial MVP

Do not include initially:

* authentication;
* user accounts;
* database;
* private Nuuka access;
* real BMS integration;
* operational control of building systems;
* real maintenance alerts;
* real occupant tracking;
* a complete BIM model;
* a production-grade digital twin;
* multi-building management;
* predictive machine learning;
* complex backend infrastructure;
* commercial deployment claims;
* official WSP or Oodi branding.

These may be future concepts but should not delay the MVP.

---

## 14. Product Integrity

This is not an operational digital twin.

It is a working interactive prototype that combines:

* verified public building data;
* weather information;
* architectural context;
* digital-experience design;
* clearly identified simulated operational layers.

Preferred description:

> A browser-based smart-building experience combining real public energy data, weather context and a clearly identified conceptual IoT layer.
